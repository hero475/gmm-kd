Keystroke Dynamics using Gaussian Mixture Model

You can run main.m script to call all necessary functions subsequently.
I suggest to call the functions one by one and understand what each does.

Keystroke dynamics is one of the efficient and inexpensive techniques that can authenticate computer users in the background while the user is actively working at the terminal. Typing characteristics have been shown to be distinctive enough to distinguish a computer user from another because of the unique timing of keystrokes that each individual performs during typing. There have been many proposed techniques for authenticating users using statistical approaches and machine learning.
